Predict Salary Based on Years of Experience

Objective: 
-- 
Using Linear Regression to Predict Salary Based on Years of Experience

DataSet: 2 Columns, 30 Observations
Variable 1: Years of Experience
Variable 2: Salary

Assumptions of Linear Regression:
--
1. Linear Relationship between the features and target
2. Little or no Multicollinearity between the features
3. Homoscedasticity Assumption
4. Normal distribution of error terms
5. Little or No autocorrelation in the residuals

Given that all of these assumptions are met: 
--
Train & Predict:
--
- Split the dataset into a training and test set
- Split the test by 1/3 and the rest of the data will return to the train
- Random state: used in conjunction with the random number generator

Fitting Simple Linear Regression to the Training set

Based on this survey dataset, You can offer a canidate with 6 years of experience a salary of $212,929.30. 

As an professional who wishes transfer into another  field, I was curious to know what would one year of experience look like. 
Thus, a canidate with 0 years of experience can be offered a salary of $71,022.50.
